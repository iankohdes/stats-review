# Statistics Review

Review of statistical concepts using simulation.

## Set up virtual environment

First, make sure the `uv` Python package manager is installed. I installed mine using `cargo` since I already have Rust installed.

```bash
>>> uv venv stats-review
Using CPython 3.13.3 interpreter at: /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/bin/python3.13
Creating virtual environment at: stats-review
Activate with: source stats-review/bin/activate
```

After activating the environment, one should see the environment mentioned above the CLI prompt:

```bash
(stats-review)
>>> 
```

To deactivate the environment, type this:

```bash
>>> deactivate
```
